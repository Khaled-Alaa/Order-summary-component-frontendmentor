## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Match the design as I can with using flexbox

```html
<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

### Continued development

incoming projects, I will use BEM methodology in naming classes
